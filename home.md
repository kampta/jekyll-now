I am a neural plumber  at [Tesla Optimus](https://www.tesla.com/AI) team.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Graphics, and Robotics.
My long-term goal is to build intelligent agents that can <em>see</em> (through vision, audio, and other senses), <em>interact</em> (navigate and act in an environment), and
<em>reason</em> (plan long-term actions from sparse rewards).

<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Graphics, and Machine Learning. 
My long term goal is to learn from Internet-scale data and enable storytellers to create intricate 3D visual content seamlessly. -->
I got my Ph.D in Artificial Intelligence at 
<a href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland College Park</a>. I also interned at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs">NVIDIA</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon</a> AI Labs.
Before starting my Ph. D., I spent 5 years prototyping and scaling Vision and ML products in both industry 
(<a href="http://netradyne.com/">Netradyne</a>, 
<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/in/careers/ai-labs.html">American Express</a>), 
and academia (<a href="https://data61.csiro.au">NICTA</a>, 
<a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/english">ITRI</a>, <a href="https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>, 
<a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in">IIT Delhi</a>).
I also co-founded a startup helping users design their wardrobes by "learning" a fashion knowledge graph from social network data.

# Blog
**Y**et **A**nother **M**achine **L**earning blog written with an intention of

* learning more by coding and writing. I strongly believe that the best way to learn a concept is to either code it myself or write a tutorial about it. This helps in both understanding various nuances associated with the concept as well as retain the concept for a longer time.
* keeping notes of various lectures/articles/papers/books/ideas I (have) come across. 

Check out the [blog page](http://kampta.github.io/blog) for more.

## Lernen durch Codierung
is german for Learning by Coding. It's a play on [Learning by Teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), a strategy for students to learn by teaching their peers popular in Germany.

## Disclaimer
Contents of this blog are inference of a biological neural network, trained over a very tiny dataset for a very long time. Any statistically significant correlation to existing literature is not coincidental but an outcome of overfitting.

## Website
Finally moving from [old page](https://sites.google.com/site/kamalgupta308/) to Jekyll, hoping to do some justice to the new website cum blog. Promising myself to be more regular and more meticulous.
