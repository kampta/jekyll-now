I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) at [University of Maryland College Park](https://www.umd.edu). I am working with [Larry Davis](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~lsd/) and [Abhinav Shrivastava](http://abhinavsh.info).
In the past, I had fun building large-scale, commercial robotics and AI products in both industry and academia, specifically

* [Amazon AWS Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/)
* [Netradyne](http://netradyne.com/)
* American Express Big Data Labs (Now [Amex AI Labs](https://www.americanexpress.com/in/careers/ai-labs.html))
* NICTA (Now [Data 61](https://data61.csiro.au/))
* [Carnegie Mellon University](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu) ([Sanjiv Singh](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~ssingh/Sanjiv_Singh/home.html), [Srinivasa Narasimhan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas/), [Stephen Nuske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-nuske-7ab4842/))
* [Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/)
* [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) ([Manik Varma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/manik/), [S V N Vishwanathan](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~vishy/), [Santanu Chaudhury](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~santanuc/))

I also briefly co-founded a startup helping users build and improve their wardrobe by bringing fast fashion recommendations from social networks.

### Research
I primarily work in Machine Learning and its applications in Vision, Graphics, Language and Robotics. I am also interested in building products with real-world impact in health-care, finance, sports and transportation. Check out the [research page](http://kampta.github.io/research) for more.

### Blog
This is **Y**et **A**nother **M**achine **L**earning blog written with an intention of

* learning more by coding and writing. I strongly believe that the best way to learn a concept is to either code it myself or write a tutorial about it. This helps in both understanding various nuances associated with the concept as well as retain the concept for a longer time.
* keeping notes of various lectures/articles/papers/books/ideas I (have) come across. 

Check out the [blog page](http://kampta.github.io/blog) for more.

### Lernen durch Codierung
is german for Learning by Coding. It's a play on [Learning by Teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), a strategy for students to learn by teaching their peers popular in Germany.

### Disclaimer
Contents of this blog are inference of a biological neural network, trained over a very tiny dataset for a very long time. Any statistically significant correlation to existing literature is not coincidental but an outcome of overfitting.

### Website
Finally moving from [old page](https://sites.google.com/site/kamalgupta308/) to Jekyll, hoping to do some justice to the new website cum blog. Promising myself to be more regular and more meticulous.
