### Self
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park.
My research interests are in semi-supervised representation learning and generative modeling primarily using deep neural networks.
I am also interested in applications of AI in health-care, finance and transportation.

I am also an engineer and an entrepreneur.
I have enjoyed building large-scale, commercial robotics and AI products in both industry
(Netradyne, American Express) and academia (NICTA, Carnegie Mellon University, IIT Delhi).

### Blog
This is **Y**et **A**nother **M**achine **L**earning blog written with an intention of

* learning more by coding and writing. I strongly believe that the best way to learn a concept is to either code it myself or write a tutorial about it. This helps in both understanding various nuances associated with the concept as well as retain the concept for a longer time.
* keeping notes of various lectures/articles/papers/books/ideas I (have) come across. 

### Lernen durch Codierung
is german for Learning by Coding. It's a play on [Learning by Teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), a strategy for students to learn by teaching their peers popular in Germany.

### Disclaimer
Contents of this blog are inference of a biological neural network, trained over a very tiny dataset for a very long time. Any statistically significant correlation to existing literature is not coincidental but an outcome of overfitting.

### Website
Finally moving from [old page](https://sites.google.com/site/kamalgupta308/) to Jekyll, hoping to do some justice to the new website cum blog. Promising myself to be more regular and more meticulous.
