Finally moving from [old page](https://sites.google.com/site/kamalgupta308/) to Jekyll, hoping to do some justice to the new website cum blog. Promising myself to be more regular and more meticulous.

It is a **Y**et **A**nother **M**achine **L**earning blog written with an intention of

* Keeping notes of various lectures/articles/papers/books/ideas I (have) come across
* Learning more by coding and writing

**Disclaimer** - Contents of this blog are inference of a biological neural network, trained over a very tiny dataset for a very long time. Any statistically significant correlation to existing literature is not coincidental but an outcome of overfitting.

**Lernen durch Codierung** - is german for Learning by Coding. It's a play on [Learning by Teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), a strategy for students to learn by teaching their peers.
